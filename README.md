MYSTERY-WORD Game (aka Hangman)

The program is a basic word guessing game. It asks for the user to choose a difficulty level, then picks a word with a length based on the difficulty. The user then guesses a letter at a 
time and it checks if the guess was correct. It will print out a correct or incorrect message, show the word with correct letters displayed and the others blank, and if the word is 
complete will tell the user they won. The game then asks if they would like to play again.
